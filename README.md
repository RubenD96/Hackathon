# Hackathon Nedap

Specialization: Web & Hybrid Application Development

The assignment is to create a hybrid app for Nedap healthcare using the suite of Nedap products called "Ons".
A few suggestions to use are:
  - Camera functionality of both Android and iOs
  - Using Nedap API's, the external API can be found at: https://www.ons-api.nl/v1/getting-started/this-documentation-site
  
Our application is used by people close to other people having a physical emergency and need help immediately. Using the 
app, they can send pictures of their injuries together with their location to Nedap healthcare, after which they will 
receive information on what to do.

The platform of the app is ionic, to install this you first need npm. Cordova is an open-source mobile development 
framework. It allows you to use standard web technologies - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform development.
